  About Me

</h1>
</head>

<body>
I am currently a Senior at Weston High School. Some interesting facts about me are I love math and science, I am a runner, and I really enjoy involving myself in community service. I really love engineering and a few projects that I have involved myself are creating a ziplining robot, designing an experiment alongside an MIT instructor measuring the Average Mold Depth in Bread Depending on Time Exposure to Air Borne Microbes, and currently I am working on creating an app that measures the topographical surface anatomy of scoliosis. My involvement in service projects include rebuilding the home of a hurricane Sandy victim and working as a Junior Mentor and Lead Junior Mentor with Science Club for Girls.
